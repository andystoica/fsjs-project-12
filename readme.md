# ISS Location and Weather Tracker

ISS Tracker is a simple demonstrative app created in node.js for the Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree.

It uses a variety of technologies covered in numerous web development courses in this techdegree, including Express for routing, Pug as a templating engine as well Mongodb and mongoose for database storage.

The responsive front end has been built on a customised version of popular Bootstrap 4 framework. The application features a complete user registration / login system implemented with express-session and allows different levels of access to public and registered users.

ISS tracker uses the open-notify.org API to track the position of the ISS, fetches ground level weather data from the Dark Sky API and displays that information using markers and information windows through the Google Map Javascript API.
